# ece_demand_visualiser

The early childhood education (ECE) demand visualiser joins together data from the Ministry of Education and Statistics New Zealand into an interactive visualisation of demand for ECE services in New Zealand. 

The application presents two views of ECE demand in New Zealand: national and locality.

The 'national view' shows: 
- the overall demand for ECE services in New Zealand based on the estimated ECE population attending and the number of ECE places available in New Zealand
- the ECE demand broken down and ranked by Territorial Authority
